****Bike Sharing Demand Prediction****

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting bike demand for a rental company by using supervised machine learning models. The objective is to accurately forecast bike demand at different times, aiding the company in optimizing inventory and pricing decisions.

The dataset includes various features such as rental counts, date and time, weather conditions, seasonality, holidays, and functionality of the service. Through data preparation, feature selection, and model training, we developed a model with an R-squared value of 0.91 and a mean absolute error of 2.58, providing reliable predictions and valuable insights into the key factors influencing demand.

**Problem Statement**

With rental bikes becoming a staple in urban transportation, it's essential to maintain a stable supply for users to reduce wait times. The goal of this project is to build a highly accurate model that minimizes mean absolute error and maximizes R-squared value. Additionally, the model should offer actionable insights into factors affecting bike demand, enabling data-driven decisions for operational efficiency.

**Approach**

**1. Initial Analysis and Data Preparation**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed dataset features, identified key trends, and assessed variable relationships.
Categorical Variables: Reviewed and encoded categorical features, removing those dominated by a single class.
Numerical Variables: Assessed distributions, correlations, and relevance to bike rental counts.
Feature Engineering: Applied transformations, removed low-variance features, and encoded categorical variables for model compatibility.

**2. Model Selection and Training**

**The following machine learning algorithms were tested:**

Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Ridge Regression
Elastic Net Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting

**3. Model Optimization**

Hyperparameter Tuning: Used GridSearchCV to refine models.
Best Model: Gradient Boosting achieved the highest R² score (0.91), indicating strong predictive power.

**4. Model Evaluation**
Models were evaluated based on:

R-squared (R²)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

**Insights and Results**

**Key Findings**

Peak Demand Hours: Demand peaks around 8-9 AM and 6-7 PM.
Seasonal Trends: Higher demand observed during summer months.
Weather Impact: Clear weather correlates with increased bike rentals.
Temperature Effect: Optimal demand seen between 22°C and 25°C.


**Feature Importance**
Significant features influencing demand included:

Temperature
Functioning Day
Humidity
Rainfall
Solar Radiation
Future Considerations
Adaptability: Future model iterations should account for seasonal changes and evolving weather conditions.
Continuous Learning: As machine learning advancements continue, ongoing updates will ensure the model adapts to new trends and data patterns.
Conclusion
The final model is a robust tool for predicting bike demand, helping the rental company manage resources efficiently. Additionally, insights on peak times, weather influence, and seasonal patterns support data-driven decisions to improve service accessibility and customer satisfaction.
